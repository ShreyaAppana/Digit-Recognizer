This is a digit recognizer project on MNIST datastet.
This project focuses on different dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE to visualize the 784 dimensions data onto 2 dimenions.
We concluded that for this dataset, t-SNE technique segregates the data and groups them in an effective way.
